## Introduction

Cosmos is a modern logic scripting language with a simple syntax.

```javascript
rel main()
    x = io.read()
    io.writeln("hello, "+x+'!')
```

Cosmos combines features from functional (including type checking), object-oriented and even logic programming.

Relational programming
--

As a logic programming language, Cosmos allows programming using relations. Unlike functions, relations may yield multiple results.

```javascript
> x=1 or x=2
| x=1
| x=2
```

See below.

Documentation
--

See the [Quickstart](/quickstart.html) or the full [Guide](/guide.html)*.

The guide is meant to be more comprehensive and eventually provide a full documentation of the language. It may still need some proof-reading. The Quickstart is a quicker intro that assumes you have prior experience with procedural or functional languages.
