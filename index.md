## Introduction

Cosmos is a modern logic scripting language.

```javascript
rel main()
    x = io.read()
    io.writeln("hello, "+x+'!')
```

Cosmos combines features from functional (including type checking), object-oriented and even logic programming with a simple syntax.

Relational programming
--

As a logic programming language, Cosmos allows programming using relations. Unlike functions, relations may yield multiple results.

```javascript
> x=1 or x=2
| x=1
| x=2
```

See below.
